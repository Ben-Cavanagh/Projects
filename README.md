## DataAnalysis
**Summary:** Created a program to analyse data taken from images of elderly participants performing daily activities.

**Details:**
- **Language Used:** Java  
- **Classes:** Main class ('DataAnalysis'), 'ImageRecord' class, and 'ActivityRecord' class.
- **Dataset:** Images organised by activity classes and participants that capture daily activities of 26 elderly people.
- **Process:**
  1. Search through all dataset folders to create a collection of image records.
  2. Sort image records chronologically for each participant.
  3. Output sorted records into a file as a long table.
  4. For each participant, define start and end time for all their activities, calculate duration of activities, and determine a representative image for each activity.
  5. Print a separate activity table for each participant containing the above information.

## JobScheduler1

**Details:**
- **Language Used:** Java
- **Process:**
  1. Connect to the server (simulator) and receive a list of jobs.
